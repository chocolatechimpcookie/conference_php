					<p> Although we expect great readability and legibility for the papers that are submitted, the content is what intrigues us the most.
					Nevertheless, here are some tips. Submit your paper as soon as you can. We have to read hundreds of submissions and earlier papers tend to stick in our minds.
					Make sure the paper is throughly reviewed. Citations should be available when needed. We will look at some of your sources. Be original.
					Break the boundaries. But most of all, enjoy it!</p>
